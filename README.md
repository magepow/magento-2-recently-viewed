## Magento 2 Recently Viewed Product extension

Help customers (logged-in customers) see the products they follow up close on your website in style.

### Description

Many studies of customer behavior on electronic websites have shown that customers often tend to search for products they have previously viewed on the website. There are many different reasons: compare prices, compare features with the product they are currently viewing, or simply want to buy that product.

Therefore, Magepow released [**Magento 2 Recently Viewed Products**](https://magepow.com/magento-2-recently-viewed-products.html) to help the website optimize the customer experience on the page, while increasing sales for the store.
